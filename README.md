## Agent Discovery

Start agent discovery at `https://telnyx.com/agents/start`. The surfaces below are the canonical repo-owned or repo-linked entry points that agents should use without guessing.

The repo-owned source mirrors for that public path live in [`agents/start.md`](/agents/start.md), [`agent.json`](/agent.json), [`auth.md`](/auth.md), [`agent-signup.md`](/agent-signup.md), [`/.well-known/agent-access.json`](/.well-known/agent-access.json), [`/.well-known/agent-card.json`](/.well-known/agent-card.json), [`/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`](/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json), [`/ai/capabilities.json`](/ai/capabilities.json), [`/ai/pricing.json`](/ai/pricing.json), [`AGENTS.md`](/AGENTS.md), and [`llms.txt`](/llms.txt). The corresponding public mirrors are `https://telnyx.com/AGENTS.md`, `https://telnyx.com/llms.txt`, `https://telnyx.com/ai/capabilities.json`, and `https://telnyx.com/ai/pricing.json`.

For Hermes Agent and OpenClaw users, the Telnyx-owned SMS platform adapter lives in [`/telnyx-hermes-sms`](/telnyx-hermes-sms). Start with [`telnyx-hermes-sms/README.md`](/telnyx-hermes-sms/README.md) for the installer CLI, Hermes plugin enablement steps, and the current canonical install path. Today the canonical install path is the GitHub repo install command; once GitHub Releases are published, the tagged release path should become the stable default.

For direct-name retrieval, treat `Telnyx Webhooks` as a first-class discovery artifact alongside auth, MCP, OpenAPI, pricing, and skills. The live `Telnyx webhooks guide` is `https://developers.telnyx.com/development/api-fundamentals/webhooks/receiving-webhooks`, and the repo-owned mirror source is [`guides/webhooks.md`](/guides/webhooks.md).

Governed execution metadata is exposed in the canonical manifest and discovery docs using four fields: `risk_class`, `approval_expectation`, `memory_scope`, and `model_behavior`. Risk classes are `read_only`, `guarded_write`, and `live_write`; side-effecting flows should be confirmed before mutation and explicitly approved before external effects, production provisioning, or spending.

For first-run evaluation, use `POST https://telnyx.com/api/inference` first. That path is `no-auth, host-authenticated`: the caller does not send a bearer token, Telnyx applies server-side auth and rate limits, and the governed-execution shape is `guarded_write`, `confirm_before_mutation`, `stateless`, `request_selected`. The main REST surface at `https://api.telnyx.com/v2` and MCP surface at `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp` remain standard API-key-authenticated paths.

## Plugins

Install the unified Telnyx plugin to give your AI coding assistant Telnyx MCP server access and 235+ Agent Skills covering messaging, voice, numbers, AI, IoT, WebRTC, Twilio migration, and more.

Empowers coding agents to generate correct, production-ready code without relying on pre-training or fragile doc retrieval.

### Claude Code Plugin

**Step 1.** Add the Telnyx marketplace (one-time setup):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add team-telnyx/ai
```

**Step 2.** Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install telnyx@telnyx
```

### Gemini CLI extension

 ```sh
  gemini extensions install https://github.com/team-telnyx/ai
```

### OpenCode

Install the Telnyx plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) to add Telnyx as a model provider with automatic auth and a TUI for managing hosted models.

```sh
# Local (current project only)
opencode plugin @telnyx/opencode

# Global (all projects)
opencode plugin -g @telnyx/opencode
```

See [`plugins/opencode/README.md`](/plugins/opencode/README.md) for full setup and configuration.

### Cursor                                                

> [!NOTE]
> Note: Our Cursor Marketplace listing is pending. 

In the meantime, install skills via the [Skills CLI](#agent-skills).

Add the Telnyx MCP server to your project's `.cursor/mcp.json`:                                                                                                
```json       
  {                                                         
    "mcpServers": {
      "telnyx": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
```

## Agent Toolkit

Integrate Telnyx APIs with popular agent frameworks through function calling — available in [Python](/tools/python) and [TypeScript](/tools/typescript).

For external or approval-sensitive agents, prefer a focused governed MCP App before exposing raw toolkit tools. The governed OpenAI, LangChain, and CrewAI examples live under [`tools/python/examples`](/tools/python/examples).

### Python

```sh
pip install telnyx-agent-toolkit
```

```python
from telnyx_agent_toolkit.openai.toolkit import TelnyxAgentToolkit

toolkit = TelnyxAgentToolkit(
    api_key="KEY_...",
    configuration={
        "actions": {
            "messaging": {"send_sms": True},
            "numbers": {"search_phone_numbers": True, "buy_phone_number": True}
        }
    }
)

tools = toolkit.get_openai_tools()
```

Works with OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI. See [Python docs](/tools/python) for full usage and [examples](/tools/python/examples).

### TypeScript

```sh
npm install @telnyx/agent-toolkit
```

```typescript
import { TelnyxAgentToolkit } from "@telnyx/agent-toolkit/langchain";

const toolkit = new TelnyxAgentToolkit(process.env.TELNYX_API_KEY!, {
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      messaging: { send_sms: true },
      numbers: { search_phone_numbers: true, buy_phone_number: true },
    },
  },
});

const tools = toolkit.getLangChainTools();
```

Works with LangChain and Vercel's AI SDK. See [TypeScript docs](/tools/typescript) for full usage.
 for the full list of commands and options.

## Agent Skills

Install individual skills for your coding assistant via the [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add team-telnyx/ai --skill <SKILL> --agent <AGENT>
```

> [!NOTE]
> See [Skills](/skills/README.md) for full install instrcuctions and comprehensive list of available skills


## Agent CLI

Composite commands that reduce multi-step Telnyx workflows to a single command. Built for AI agents and developers who want to provision infrastructure without orchestrating multiple API calls.

```sh
telnyx-agent setup-sms        # Buy number + create messaging profile + assign
telnyx-agent setup-voice       # Create SIP connection + buy number + assign
telnyx-agent setup-ai          # Create AI assistant + buy number + wire together
telnyx-agent setup-ai --preset appointment-reminders
telnyx-agent setup-porting     # Check portability + create porting order + submit
telnyx-agent status            # Account health overview
```

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output.

For assistant-first discovery, use the CLI as the bootstrap path and the guides as the model-specific path:

- [`/guides/ai-assistants.md`](/guides/ai-assistants.md) shows the current Telnyx-hosted OpenAI assistant examples. The examples currently pin `openai/gpt-5.4`; verify against `GET /v2/ai/models` or `telnyx ai models` before automating around that exact ID.
- [`/guides/voice-agent-onboarding.md`](/guides/voice-agent-onboarding.md) shows the first live voice-agent path, including the assistant answer webhook.
- [`/guides/ai-receptionist-missed-call.md`](/guides/ai-receptionist-missed-call.md) shows a bounded SMB receptionist flow for missed-call capture, live transfer, and SMS callback confirmation.
- `telnyx-agent setup-ai` stays bootstrap-oriented in the README because the CLI should optimize for a working account-level setup, not silently promise that one hosted model is available on every account.
- `telnyx-agent setup-ai --preset appointment-reminders|support-handoff|lead-recovery` is the fastest cold-start path when you want a callable starter without authoring the full voice prompt first.

See [Agent CLI](/cli)


## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Telnyx hosts a remote MCP server at `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp`. The machine-readable MCP server card lives at `https://telnyx.com/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`.

For auth discovery, start at `https://telnyx.com/auth.md`. An unauthenticated MCP `initialize` probe is expected to return `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://api.telnyx.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/v2/mcp"`.

To run a local Telnyx MCP server using npx:

```sh
npx -y @telnyx/mcp --api-key=YOUR_TELNYX_API_KEY
```

See [MCP](/tools/mcp) for more details about the generic API MCP proxy.

### MCP Apps

[`tools/mcp-apps`](/tools/mcp-apps) contains app-layer MCP servers with MCP Apps UI resources for focused Telnyx workflows. These are separate from the generic `@telnyx/mcp` proxy above.

Use MCP Apps when the agent should stay on a read-first or preview-first contract with least-privilege credentials. Use the generic proxy only when you intentionally need the broader Telnyx API MCP surface.

Public discoverability boundary: the generic API MCP endpoint at `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mcp` is not the public MCP Apps surface and should not be presented as one. Public MCP Apps discovery lives on the docs-hosted wrapper under `https://developers.telnyx.com/apps`, where each app gets its own discovery document and MCP endpoint that can expose `tool_names` and `ui://` resources.

Current apps:

- Governed Communications (`tools/mcp-apps/apps/governed-communications`)
- Number Intelligence (`tools/mcp-apps/apps/number-intelligence`)
- Usage & Cost Explorer (`tools/mcp-apps/apps/usage-cost-explorer`)
- Voice Monitor (`tools/mcp-apps/apps/voice-monitor`)

From `tools/mcp-apps`, use `npm install`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`.

The public docs-facing MCP Apps discovery contract lives on `https://developers.telnyx.com` with these proof URLs:

- `https://developers.telnyx.com/.well-known/mcp-app-registry.json`
- `https://developers.telnyx.com/.well-known/mcp-apps.json`
- `https://developers.telnyx.com/apps/number-intelligence`
- `https://developers.telnyx.com/apps/number-intelligence/mcp`

The registry and per-app discovery document are meant to stay machine-readable and lightweight: they expose bearer-auth expectations, exact MCP URLs, tool names, and `ui://` resources without requiring an agent to parse the heavier docs shell first.

From the repo root, `npm run verify:live-docs-mcp-apps` probes that hosted surface and reports whether the public registry, per-app discovery document, tool annotations, and `ui://` resources are actually visible end-to-end.

Validation note: what is public is the docs-hosted registry, app catalog, per-app discovery document, and app-specific MCP endpoint. What remains intentionally separate/private is the generic Telnyx API MCP runtime, which stays a broader bearer-auth proxy and does not double as the public MCP Apps catalog.

## Guides

Curl-first operational guides for common Telnyx workflows — SMS messaging, voice call control, AI assistants, phone numbers, porting, verification, webhooks, 10DLC registration, WireGuard networking, x402 payments, Edge Compute handoff patterns, and [evidence handoff / escalation runbooks](/guides/evidence-handoff.md).

For current assistant examples, start with [AI Voice Assistants](/guides/ai-assistants.md). That guide currently pins `openai/gpt-5.4` in hosted OpenAI assistant examples; treat it as an example value, not a stable default, and verify the live catalog before automation.

For the first live Telnyx voice-agent evaluation path, start with [Production Voice-Agent Onboarding](/guides/voice-agent-onboarding.md).

For a production-shaped but still bounded inbound workflow, use [AI Receptionist Missed-Call Capture](/guides/ai-receptionist-missed-call.md).

For Edge Compute specifically, the goal is to make the handoff testable fast: start from a real `telnyx-edge` example, deploy it, and let `team-telnyx/ai` orchestrate against that live endpoint.

For the managed-agent packaging pattern that ties discovery, skills, MCP apps, and least-privilege operations together, see [Managed Telecom Agents](/managed-telecom-agents.md).

For Hermes Agent or OpenClaw SMS integrations, use [`telnyx-hermes-sms/README.md`](/telnyx-hermes-sms/README.md). That repo-owned subdirectory is the fastest path when the goal is "wire Telnyx SMS into Hermes" rather than "call Telnyx APIs directly from a generic agent framework."

See [Guides](/guides) for the full list.

## Edge Compute

`team-telnyx/ai` does not currently own native Edge Compute lifecycle support.

Instead, this repo should be treated as the orchestration/discoverability layer, while the actual function lifecycle lives in the separate `team-telnyx/edge-compute` repo and the `telnyx-edge` CLI.

In practice:
- use `team-telnyx/ai` for agent workflows, capability discovery, and AI-oriented integration patterns
- use `team-telnyx/edge-compute` + `telnyx-edge` for function creation, status checks, deployment, deletion, secrets, bindings, storage/KV, and lifecycle management

The intended end state is a clean bridge:
- `ai` = orchestrates and explains
- Edge Compute = deploys and runs (prefer API-key auth for agent flows)
- the boundary between them is a documented HTTP/MCP/function contract

Current upstream examples worth starting from are `examples/ts/mcp-server` for MCP, `examples/ts/call-event-router` for typed Telnyx webhook/event routing, and `examples/js/webhook-receiver` for a minimal HTTP ingress function.

Storage/KV is intentionally documented as an upstream `telnyx-edge` capability rather than a `telnyx-agent` helper command today. This repo should point to that surface clearly without pretending to own it.

See [Edge Compute guide](/guides/edge-compute.md).
