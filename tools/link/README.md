# Telnyx Link

Telnyx Link is an AI companion for Telnyx employees. It is intended to help employees navigate customers, systems, products, incidents, internal knowledge, and workflows through a permission-aware AI operating layer.

This MVP is intentionally safe and mocked. It does not call Slack, Salesforce, Google Workspace, Snowflake, Datadog, GitHub, Telnyx production APIs, or any other production system.

The product direction is inspired by Ramp's Glass as an internal AI coworker pattern. See [Glass-Inspired Product Reference](docs/glass-reference.md) for the design and systems principles to carry forward without copying third-party branding or assets.

## MVP Scope

- Root `Telnyx Link` agent definition
- Specialist agent stubs and routing boundaries
- Optional OpenAI Agents SDK graph for future live orchestration
- Mocked tool gateway with safety metadata
- Markdown skill loader with frontmatter validation
- OKF bundle validation for Archive imports
- Shared customer Slack draft workflow
- Approval decision model
- Managed Link App Publisher API contract
- Managed Link Skill Registry API contract for stars, installs/downloads, and runs
- In-memory audit logger
- Memory service placeholders
- CLI surfaces for chat, skills, and shared-channel draft mode

## Run Locally

```bash
cd tools/link
npm ci
npm run link:dev -- "brief me on Acme Messaging"
npm run link:skill -- "SMS Delivery Investigation"
npm run link:shared-channel
npm exec -- telnyx-link app-publisher 4300 --storage ./publisher-catalog.json --dev-no-auth
npm exec -- telnyx-link skill-registry 4310 --storage ./skill-registry.json --dev-no-auth
```

Verification:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Architecture

```text
Telnyx Link surfaces
  -> LinkRuntime
     -> root Telnyx Link agent
     -> specialist agent registry
     -> markdown skills loader
     -> mocked tool gateway
     -> policy and approval model
     -> audit logger
     -> memory placeholders
```

The OpenAI Agents SDK adapter is in `src/agents/openai-sdk.ts`. The mocked local runtime does not require an OpenAI API key. Live SDK mode should only be used after explicit authorization and environment setup.

## Link App Publisher

`src/app-publisher.ts` contains the managed publisher API contract used by Link Desktop:

- `POST /publish-intents`
- `POST /apps/{id}/versions`
- `GET /apps`
- `GET /apps/{id}`
- `GET /apps/{id}/deployments`
- `GET /apps/{id}/deployments/{deploymentId}/logs`
- `GET /apps/{id}/versions`
- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /metrics`
- `POST /apps/{id}/duplicate`
- `POST /apps/{id}/reviews`
- `POST /apps/{id}/rollback`
- `POST /apps/{id}/ownership`
- `POST /apps/{id}/deprecations`

The service accepts only VPN-access apps, requires an internal auth header by default, stores source refs instead of local files, rejects non-`team-telnyx` source repos, persists catalog state when `--storage` or `LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_STORAGE` is set, records preview/production deployment status, exposes sanitized deployment logs, keeps version history for rollback, supports ownership transfer/deprecation, and never returns local `.env` or secret values in duplicate responses. Duplicate handoffs return structured clone/checkout/subdir commands pinned to the reviewed source ref.

Local app submissions use `link-app.yml` as the desktop-side contract. Link Desktop parses the manifest, fills source repo/ref/subdir from Git when omitted, and posts the normalized publisher payload. The flat manifest shape is:

```yaml
name: Carrier Readiness Hub
slug: carrier-readiness-hub
owner_squad: messaging-ops.squad
audience: Messaging, NOC
app_type: web
install_command: npm ci
build_command: npm run build
output_dir: dist
env_schema:
  - TELNYX_API_KEY
access: vpn
reviewers:
  - messaging-ops.squad
risk_level: medium
```

The same local-app path is scriptable for smoke tests:

```bash
# Verify manifest and Git-derived source ref without submitting.
npm exec -- telnyx-link publish-local-app ./apps/carrier-readiness --dry-run

# Submit to a local or VPN publisher.
npm exec -- telnyx-link publish-local-app ./apps/carrier-readiness \
  --publisher-url=http://127.0.0.1:4300 \
  --token="$TELNYX_AUTH_REV2"

# Exercise the full local-app publisher flow:
# inspect manifest, publish preview, approve, list deployments/logs, and duplicate source handoff.
npm exec -- telnyx-link publisher-e2e-smoke ./apps/carrier-readiness \
  --publisher-url=http://127.0.0.1:4300 \
  --reviewer-groups=messaging-ops.squad \
  --token="$TELNYX_AUTH_REV2"

# Add --check-app-url to verify the approved VPN app URL is reachable.
npm exec -- telnyx-link publisher-e2e-smoke ./apps/carrier-readiness \
  --publisher-url=https://link-app-publisher.query.prod.telnyx.io \
  --reviewer-groups=messaging-ops.squad \
  --token="$TELNYX_AUTH_REV2" \
  --require-ready \
  --require-pushed-ref \
  --check-app-url
```

By default, local runs use a record-only deployer. For a production-like Edge handoff, run the same service with:

```bash
LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_DEPLOYER=telnyx-edge npm exec -- telnyx-link app-publisher 4300 --storage ./publisher-catalog.json
```

or pass `--edge-deployer`. That deployer clones the approved `team-telnyx` source ref into a temporary workspace, checks out the requested ref, runs an allowlisted `install_command` or infers one from lockfiles, runs the allowlisted `build_command` in `source_subdir`, verifies `output_dir` exists when declared, then runs `telnyx-edge ship`. It captures deployment URL/log output and records deployment status without adding Edge lifecycle ownership to Link. URLs returned by `telnyx-edge ship` must resolve under approved private Telnyx Edge hostnames such as `*.apps.telnyx.io` or `*.query.prod.telnyx.io`; unexpected public hosts fail the deployment record.

Production runs can also pass `--enforce-reviewers` or set `LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_ENFORCE_REVIEWERS=1`. In that mode, review requests must include an actor or group header matching the app's `reviewers` list or `owner_squad`; Link Desktop forwards `X-Telnyx-Actor`, `X-On-Behalf-Of`, and `X-Telnyx-Groups` when those values are configured.

For production, also pass `--require-auth-context` or set `LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_REQUIRE_AUTH_CONTEXT=1`. This requires publisher API requests to include both auth and Telnyx actor/group context from the VPN/Okta boundary, so reviewer enforcement cannot run against anonymous bearer-token calls.

For production e2e, the publisher should start with persistent storage, reviewer enforcement, and the Edge deployer:

```bash
LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_STORAGE=/var/lib/link-app-publisher/catalog.json \
LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_DEPLOYER=telnyx-edge \
LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_ENFORCE_REVIEWERS=1 \
LINK_APP_PUBLISHER_REQUIRE_AUTH_CONTEXT=1 \
npm exec -- telnyx-link app-publisher 4300

curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4300/readyz
```

`/readyz` returns `200` only when storage is configured, reviewer policy is enforced, publisher auth and actor/group context are required, Git is available, `telnyx-edge` is available, and `telnyx-edge auth status` reports an authenticated state. Record-only local mode intentionally returns `503` so it cannot be mistaken for a production-ready publisher. `/metrics` returns Prometheus text metrics including process uptime and HTTP request totals for service scraping.

The test suite includes a production-like `publisher-e2e-smoke` path with a fake `telnyx-edge` binary and a temporary Git URL rewrite. That verifies the service can clone a reviewed `team-telnyx` source ref, run install/build, run `telnyx-edge ship`, sanitize logs, approve the app, and return duplicate/fork commands without needing real Edge credentials. A real production smoke still requires the dedicated `telnyx-edge` CLI from `team-telnyx/edge-compute` and `telnyx-edge auth api-key set <your-api-key>` or equivalent authenticated state.

## Link Skill Registry

`src/skill-registry.ts` contains the managed skill tracking API used by Link Desktop:

- `GET /skills?ids=link:account-briefing,telnyx:sms`
- `GET /skills/{id}`
- `POST /skills/{id}/events`
- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /metrics`

Events use `event_type` values of `star`, `unstar`, `install`, `run`, or `view`. V1 treats `install` as the download metric. Stars and installs are unique per authenticated actor, while runs and views are counters. The service stores hashed actor keys, persists registry state when `--storage` or `LINK_SKILL_REGISTRY_STORAGE` is set, requires an internal auth header by default, and exposes Prometheus text metrics at `/metrics`.

Run it locally:

```bash
npm exec -- telnyx-link skill-registry 4310 \
  --storage ./skill-registry.json \
  --dev-no-auth
```

Production should run it as a private Edge-hosted internal service with persistent storage and actor context enforced:

```bash
LINK_SKILL_REGISTRY_STORAGE=/var/lib/link-skill-registry/registry.json \
LINK_SKILL_REGISTRY_REQUIRE_AUTH_CONTEXT=1 \
npm exec -- telnyx-link skill-registry 4310

curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4310/readyz
```

Link Desktop defaults to `https://link-skill-registry.query.prod.telnyx.io` and can be pointed at another VPN-only deployment with `LINK_SKILL_REGISTRY_URL`. If the registry is unavailable, Desktop caches local stats and queues events for a later retry.

## Link Message Gateway

`src/message-gateway.ts` contains the managed delivery harness used by Link Desktop:

- `POST /messages`
- `GET /messages`
- `GET /messages/{id}`
- `GET /messages/{id}/events`
- `POST /webhooks/slack/events`
- `POST /webhooks/google-chat/events`
- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /metrics`

The gateway stores a compact delivery ledger, not a canonical chat inbox. Message bodies are retained only for the delivery/retry window and can be redacted after retention. Recipients are canonical addresses such as `person@telnyx.com`, `agent:aida`, or `group:messaging-ops`; human recipients must resolve to active `@telnyx.com` directory entries. Routing uses an explicit `X-Link-Transport` hint first, then recipient preference, then Slack for mapped humans, Google Chat fallback, and A2A for agents.

Run it locally:

```bash
npm exec -- telnyx-link message-gateway 4320 \
  --storage ./message-gateway-ledger.json \
  --dev-no-auth
```

Production should run it as a private hosted service with persistent storage, provider secrets, webhook ingress, and actor context enforced:

```bash
LINK_MESSAGE_GATEWAY_STORAGE=/var/lib/link-message-gateway/ledger.json \
LINK_MESSAGE_GATEWAY_REQUIRE_AUTH_CONTEXT=1 \
npm exec -- telnyx-link message-gateway 4320

curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4320/readyz
```

Link Desktop defaults to `https://link-message-gateway.query.prod.telnyx.io` and can be pointed at another VPN-only deployment with `LINK_MESSAGE_GATEWAY_URL`. If the hosted gateway is unavailable, Desktop shows a local record-only ledger fallback so development can verify envelope creation without pretending a provider-authored send occurred.

## Add a Skill

Add a markdown file under `tools/link/skills`.

Required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: Account Briefing
description: Create a concise account briefing from internal context.
owner: GTM
team: Sales
risk_level: medium
tools_required:
  - salesforce.account_lookup
  - slack.search
customer_safe: false
approval_required: false
---
```

Skill bodies should include when to use it, inputs needed, workflow steps, expected output format, and safety notes.

## Add a Tool

Add mocked tools in `src/tools.ts`. Every tool must declare:

- name
- description
- category
- visibility
- capability
- risk level
- approval requirement
- whether output can be shown externally

Real implementations should live in separate modules later and must go through the same registry, audit, approval, and permission checks.

## Shared-Channel Safety

In `shared_customer` mode, Link returns:

- Customer-safe draft
- Internal rationale
- Sources used
- Approval status

Customer-facing drafts redact internal links, raw diagnostics, private records, and internal Slack channels. External posting is always approval-required.

## What Is Mocked

All current tool outputs are deterministic mocks for Slack, Salesforce, Google Workspace, Guru, Linear/Jira, GitHub, Datadog, Snowflake, Telnyx account lookup, messaging logs, voice/SIP traces, network/carrier status, and billing/revenue lookup.

## Memory Placeholder

Memory is intentionally disabled. Future memory should include daily synthesis, cleanup pipelines, source attribution, permission-aware recall, user controls, retention policy, and strict customer data boundaries.

## OKF Bundle Validation

`tools/link` includes an Open Knowledge Format v0.1 parser for Link Archive imports. It treats OKF as an interchange format, not a replacement for permission-aware memory. Concept files must be Markdown with YAML frontmatter and a non-empty `type` field; unknown fields are preserved, and broken internal links are reported as warnings so partially generated bundles remain inspectable.

## Next Milestones
